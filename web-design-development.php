									<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
									<p>
										The Co-operative Bank have identified a gap within the banking market; teenagers and their first interactions with a bank. Gaining customers at this point within their banking lifecycle is incredibly important as many customers will stay with their first bank until have a substantial reason to change. The Co-operative Bank want to revolutionise and re-think the banking sector and push to market a mobile app which allows teenagers to do their basic banking needs via a youthful and trendy mobile app that has a unique experience. The aim of this app is to start teaching the basics of financial literacy and shaping future spending and saving habits. We had one day from 9am until 5pm to come up with a solution.

									<h3>RESEARCH & INSPIRATION</h3>
									<p>
										When thinking about designing a teenage banking service I needed to really understand what makes them tick. I had a chat with our friend Zoe. Zoe’s about to turn 13. The only time she deals with money is spending her pocket money on dance accessories. She doesn’t find banking interesting but she is excited about getting her first eftpos card. Zoe’s mum is not as excited about this part. However, she does want Zoe to have independence and learn the value of money.
										<br>
										<br>
										Based on our research of teens and our chat with Zoe we were able to define the key needs for those using our banking service. They need to gain some independence by using the app. They need to feel rewarded in order to enjoy the experience. They have little knowledge of banking so need to be guided through their experience. And lastly, they need to develop positive habits that are encouraged by the app.
										<br>
										<br>
										With these needs in mind, I started to seek out existing digital platforms that were working towards similar goals. ASB’s Clever Kash works well as it encourages children to value money by reintroducing physical coins into the equation. Pocopay rewards the user through animate bubble gestures that give a response to user interactions. Mint guides the user by colour coding and simplifying information. We also were inspired by the visual language used in other digital banking services particularly the use of iconography, circles, vibrant colours and data visualisation.

									<h3>SKETCHES & WIREFRAMES</h3>
									<p>

										With our market research and design inspiration on our side, my vision was to create something that was interactive like a game, personalised like social media and rewarding like earning you first pay check. We started with drawing up ideas on a whiteboard to get a sense of how all the interactions would link up to each other and to also decide on which interactions and parts of the app were the most important since the team was on a time restraint. From here we chose our main parts of the app;  Home screen showing different accounts, saving goal section and payment with phones section and did some rapid prototyping. Spending 1 min on each idea and rotating to get a range of ideas out in a short amount of time. After we had finished doing a couple rounds of this we picked the ideas we likes the most, pushed them a little bit further and and brought them into Sketch to start making the wireframes.

									<h3>THE MOCKUPS</h3>
									<p>

										There’s many things that makes Pocket great but the four key functions we’re going to mention are the dashboard, goals, awards and transactions. I'll begin just like the user does, on the dashboard. Zoe only has two accounts so we’ve developed an easier way for her to navigate through them by swiping right. Her navigation bar is built in a similar style to that of her phone. We purposefully avoided large drop down menus and stripped back the functions to exactly what Zoe would need. This menu could be customisable so that as Zoe grows and her banking needs change, she can drag and drop in different functions.
										<br>
										<br>
										When Zoe views her transactions through Pocket, she sees her spendings and earnings like a journey. Each day is represented like a path so that she sees the relationship between her transactions rather than one endless list. The goals section of Pocket brings the interactive style of Pocopay to life. Zoe can drag the outer circle to set her goal. As she saves, the inner circle grows until finally Yay! She reaches her goal and Pocket celebrates with some confetti! The animated nature of this function shows Zoe a visual representation of money. It creates a lifelike quality to the app where the it shrinks and grows depending on her actions. The awards part of Pocket encourages good banking habits. Zoe receives different awards based on positive interactions she’s had i.e Saving for three weeks in a row or setting up your first savings account. This awards system provides Zoe with an incentive to keep using Pocket. In order to bring the social aspect of popular apps into Pocket, I also proposed that these awards could be viewed and shared by Zoe’s friends. This is a better way of comparing achievements without actually sharing private information.

									<h3>OUTCOME</h3>
									<p>
									To bring all the parts of Pocket together, I have developed a visual language based on the existing branding for Co-operative Bank. We chose to bring in the secondary colours to add vibrance to Pocket without making it too childlike. The use of circles allowed us to make written information more visually interesting. The use of icons is similar to those found in games and social media - they are simple yet still descriptive. The tone of voice used was really important as it personalises the experience: making Zoe feel like Pocket is designed especially for her.
									<br>
									<br>
									Pocket has been designed with its users at the forefront of both the research and design. It’s personalised, it’s rewarding, it’s interactive and most of all: it makes banking something teenagers would want to engage with.

								<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
								<p>
									This was a two day hack-fest, hosted at Powershop. In teams of 5 split up of 1 designer and 4 coders we had to make a web application with api data relevant to New Zealand. The idea I came up with was to use the Trade Me api to find out average rent prices in different areas to make deciding which area to rent a less painful task. The main user in mind was people moving to a new city and looking for the cheapest place to rent, relative to the city. I pushed this idea further by adding in apis relevant to crime rate in areas as well as heating/electrical costs.
								</p>
								<h3>REASEARCH</h3>
								<p>
									​I first researched what services like mine were out there. I found that there were a range of services that looked at average prices like numbeo.com for example. You input two cities around the world and it gave you price comparisons. I found this was a common service provided by many sites and where flat smart differed itself by just focusing in on New Zealand and going one step further to compare suburbs.
								</p>
								<h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
								<p>
									I wanted this web application to be simplistic for the user so I ended up going for 2 inputs on the home page and then have all the information appear below after the search button was pressed. A simple user navigation below shows how the user can make multiple searches with ease, since there is purposely as little steps as possible. I also explored and did iterations with data visualisation. This is an important part since information needs to be conveyed to the user easily so they can digest all the information quickly and clearly. With final wireframes I chose to go with stats paired with a shape so when they make multiple searches they will instantly identify the shapes with a certain bit of information, making it faster to go through the information.

								<h3>THE OUTCOME</h3>
								<p>
									With only 2 days to complete a project. The team and I managed to successfully put together a working website that let's the user compare two suburbs and make choosing where to flat an easier process. While if not for the time restriction more user testing would have been possible to refine the end product we completed the MVP that was set out at the start of the 2 days.

								Traveller is a website for tourists wanting to travel around New Zealand. In collaboration with NZ tourism this is a website that helps you organise your trip around New Zealand. It is a simple service where you input your start and end location, how many people are going, how many days and then the type of vehicle you wish to hire. Once all the inputs are completed you click calculate and it will give you google maps with the quickest route and distance. As well as this, the user will also get estimated prices for fuel consumption for this trip and vehicle rental hire costs.

							<p>
								This challenge was to pick an existing restaurant or cafe and make a digital ordering system for it. I decided to go for Leeds Street bakery as I thought it could get a lot of use out of one. The idea behind it that orders around peak times would not slow down the service by making the ordering part of the business as seamless as possible. Main features being the cart and seeing at all times how many is in your cart. Also a timer where you would get estimated times for how long your order would be.
