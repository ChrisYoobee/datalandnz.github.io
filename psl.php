									<h2>My Role</h2>
									<p>
										I was in charge of creating the new website for PSL and every other responsibility that holds. I had help from the owner to get a clear idea of what was expected with the end results of the website. After that I was steering the whole
										operation from the user research to the last typed word.

									<h2>The Challenge</h2>
									<p>
										The old website was outdated, clunky and frustrating to navigate. My biggest challenge was to turn this around and make it a beautifully crafted website where the users don't have to think about the navigation.
										<br>
										<br>
										Another challenge was to make sure it scaled to go on desktop mobile and tablet formats.

									<h2>THE APPROACH</h2>
									<p>
										<strong> Finding the problems I was fixing</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										My first step was to have a meeting with the business owner discuss the problems that the current website has and the best way to solve them. Since navigation was a big issue I started with this.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>User testing</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										Getting feedback early on to save time on making big changes halfway through the project.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Wireframes</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										Creating clarity for the architecture of the website.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Iterations</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										I went back to user testing for every iteration until the owner of the site and myself were happy in how the final result would be.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>Building the website</strong>
										<br>
										<br>
										I used a website builder (Weebly) to create the website. This meant I could build the website faster than it being coded. The only downside to this would be flexibility but I had my restraints in mind when creating the user flows right at the start..

									<h2>THE START</h2>
									<p>
									User navigation is the first action I took towards building the website. The old website had over
									10 options in the drop down menu which made navigation confusing. With that mental note I set
									out to simplify the navigation and with working through options with the owner and managed to
									drop it down to 5 on the drop down menu.

									<h2>Using a CMS</h2>
									<p>
										Using do-it-yourself user testing I had three friends try out the current website and give me back feedback on the navigation of the old website in general first. I then asked them to go to a specific page while I watched them do it. I noticed that it got very confusing with one drop down menu having 10 different options I realize that my users aren't the typical people who would use the website but it was more of an exercise to learn problems encountered when looking for a specific product. I had the owner of the business do the same exercise and found that while he completed it faster there was still frustration from a user who knows the website very well.
										<br>
										<br>
										I used InVision (prototyping tool) to quickly turn my wire-frames into a clickable shelled out website with navigation. I then proceeded to use simple A B testing to continue my iterations.
										<br>
										<br>
										Below I have the final wire-frames for the website. The home page is done in a simple three stage way where you have the banner which is of previous work to get customers interested and show their work. Lower down are bits of information to clarify what the business is about and then finally a Facebook feed to encourage users to start following the page and show them the latest news about the business.
										<br>
										<br>
										I made sure the website scaled appropriately so it would work on desktop tablet and mobile device.

									<h2>THE FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
									<p>
										With ease of use being a big factor in the final product I ended up with a final product that
										incorporated this. One problem I faced was a user’s need to search up a product. I ended up solving
										this problem by simply putting a search bar the top of the page. This meant that on any page of the
										 website you would have access to it and it was an easy to use function that wasn’t intrusive of the user
										  flow

									<h2>THE REFLECTION</h2>
									<p>
										A big problem I faced was the lack of money to do in depth user research and testing. I got around this by focusing on the navigation itself so my choices for users to test was very broad but still provided the information I needed. For more tricky user questions I had the knowledge of the owner of the website to help me out.
										<br>
										<br>
										After completing this project I also realized the importance of communication (written and verbal) and how it adds great value to the success of a website.
